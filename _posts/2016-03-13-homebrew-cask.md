Last week, I wanted to refresh my mac, so I decided to clean all my settings, by starting with a new fresh install of mac OSX.

I found a script on github to automize some settings, it's very usefull as you can update almost everything like the dock and the finder. You can find this script [here](https://github.com/j9ac9k/osxSetup).

But the thing the most interesting from this script, is the homebrew cask tool."Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didnâ€™t" as they said on their website. with Homebrew cask you will be able to download any application throught your terminal. For example, it you need atom, you just need to run `brew cask atom`, and that's it! Most of programs are present and on [their website](https://caskroom.github.io/) you can search for the alias of the application your looking for.
